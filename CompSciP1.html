    <p style="color:darkgreen"> Hello! My name is Tanaya Kuvelkar. I am an out of state student, coming from Connecticut and my family is from India. My birthday is in Decemember, but my favorite season has got to be fall. I love all the pretty colors and the weather is just right. I am a very musically inclined person, for I enjoy singing, playin the piano, dancing in musials, all sort of things. I like to spend my time travelling, hiking, making new friends... I'm a very outdoorsy and outgoing person. But that being said, I also do appreciate those moments when I'm at home and relaxed with my family and friends. In my free time, I'm a person who likes to learn different things, whether that be a new piano song, or croteching a different design. I also really like to watch movies and fully judge them. It's really fun. </p>
